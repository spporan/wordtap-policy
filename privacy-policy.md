# Privacy Policy for WordTap

**Effective Date:** August 7, 2025

WordTap is a Chrome Extension that allows users to tap on any word on a webpage to retrieve its definition, translation, and pronunciation. This privacy policy explains how your data is handled.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

WordTap does **not collect**, store, or transmit any **personally identifiable information (PII)**.

- The extension processes your interaction (the tapped word) **locally**.
- When online, it fetches information by accessing **public dictionary or translation websites** through scraping.

---

## 2. How We Use Information

- **Offline Mode:** WordTap uses locally available data or resources for basic word processing (if any are bundled).
- **Online Mode:** When internet is active, WordTap accesses publicly available dictionary/translation websites to extract relevant definitions or translations for the tapped word.

The tapped word is used **temporarily** to request information. It is not stored, logged, or shared with any third party.

---

## 3. Third-Party Websites (Scraped Sources)

WordTap does not use official APIs or SDKs. Instead, it may:
- Load content from public dictionary sites (e.g., Wiktionary, Cambridge, etc.)
- Extract visible information from those pages (scraping)

While WordTap does not share your data with these sites, accessing them means **your browser may connect** to them, subject to their own privacy policies and logging mechanisms.

---

## 4. Data Sharing

We do **not collect or share** any user data. No analytics, cookies, user accounts, or telemetry are used.

---

## 5. Permissions Disclosure

WordTap uses Chrome permissions to:
- Access the current webpage (to detect the word you tapped)
- Make network requests to public dictionary sites (only if you're online)

These permissions are **only used for the functionality described** and not for tracking or advertising.

---

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We may revise this policy in the future. All updates will be posted at the official privacy policy link and reflected by the "Effective Date" above.
